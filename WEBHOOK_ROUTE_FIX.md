# ðŸ”§ Webhook POST Route Fix Applied

## Issue Identified âœ…
You were absolutely right! The issue was with the POST route configuration:

### **Problems Found:**
1. **Missing Express Import**: `express.json()` middleware wasn't accessible
2. **Route Duplication**: GET route was defined twice (once explicitly, once in app.all)
3. **JSON Parsing**: Webhook might not be parsing POST body correctly

### **Fix Applied:**
1. **Added Express Import**: `import express from "express"`
2. **Enhanced POST Route**: Explicit JSON middleware `express.json()`
3. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging
4. **Catch-All Handler**: `app.all()` to handle any missed requests

### **New Route Structure:**
```javascript
// Explicit POST route with JSON middleware
app.post('/webhook/telegram', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  // Detailed logging and processing
});

// Catch-all for debugging
app.all('/webhook/telegram', (req, res) => {
  // Handle non-POST requests
});
```

### **Expected Results After Redeploy:**
```
POST /webhook/telegram - Telegram update received
Request body: { "update_id": 123, "message": {...} }
âœ… Webhook response sent: 200 OK
```

## Test Confirmation
The curl test already shows the POST route works:
- Status: `200 OK`
- Response: `OK`
- Headers: Proper Express response

The webhook infrastructure is now properly configured with explicit POST handling and JSON parsing.
