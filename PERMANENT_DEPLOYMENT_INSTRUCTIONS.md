# Get Your Permanent URL - Step by Step

## Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Click the "Deploy" tab** in the left sidebar of your Replit project
2. **Choose "Autoscale deployment"** for web services
3. **Configure deployment**:
   - Name: telegram-channel-marketplace
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Run command: `npm start`
4. **Add environment variables**:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (your bot token)
   - `DATABASE_URL` (will be provided)
5. **Click Deploy**

**Result**: You'll get a permanent URL like: `https://your-app-name.replit.app`

## Option 2: Manual Render.com Deployment
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect Render.com to your GitHub repo
3. Deploy using the `render.yaml` I created

## Current Development URL:
Your app is currently running at the development URL, but this stops when inactive.

## Why Not From Beginning:
- **Standard Practice**: Build → Test → Deploy
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid deployment costs during development
- **Feature Complete**: Your app now has all requested features and is ready

## Next Steps:
Use the Deploy button in Replit for instant permanent hosting!
