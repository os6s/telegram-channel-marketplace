# 🔧 Render Webhook Fix Applied

## Issue Identified
**Problem**: Webhook setup failing with 404 error
```
Webhook setup result: { ok: false, error_code: 404, description: 'Not Found' }
```

**Root Cause**: Webhook was being configured before the server routes were fully registered

## Solution Applied
### 1. ✅ Timing Fix
- Added 2-second delay before webhook setup
- Ensures server is fully initialized before webhook configuration
- Routes are registered before webhook attempts to reach them

### 2. ✅ Better Error Handling
- Improved async/await error handling for webhook setup
- Enhanced logging for production debugging

## Current Status
✅ **Service is Live**: Your Render deployment shows "Your service is live 🎉"
✅ **Health Check Working**: API health endpoint responding correctly
✅ **Bot Token Set**: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is working (no token error)
⏳ **Webhook Fix**: Applied timing fix for route registration

## Expected Results After Redeploy
- Webhook will configure successfully after 2-second delay
- Bot will respond to `/start` command
- Mini app will open from bot keyboard
- Full marketplace functionality will be active

## Test Your Bot
1. Send `/start` to your Telegram bot
2. Click "🛒 Open Marketplace" button  
3. Mini app should load your Render deployment

The webhook timing issue has been fixed - redeploy on Render to apply the changes.
