# ðŸ”§ Webhook Route Priority Fix Applied

## Root Cause Identified
**Issue**: Webhook endpoint returning HTML instead of proper webhook functionality
- Route registration order problem
- Static file serving intercepting webhook requests  
- Middleware redirects affecting webhook route

## Critical Fix Applied
### 1. âœ… Route Priority Fixed
- **Bot routes registered FIRST** (highest priority)
- Webhook routes now take precedence over static serving
- Prevents route interception by other middleware

### 2. âœ… Middleware Path Exclusions
- Skip redirect middleware for `/webhook/` and `/api/` paths
- Prevents webhook requests from being processed by visitor detection
- Ensures clean webhook endpoint access

### 3. âœ… Enhanced Debugging
- Added webhook endpoint testing
- Health check verification before webhook setup
- Detailed logging for production troubleshooting

## Expected Results After Redeploy
```
âœ… Webhook configured successfully for production
Webhook endpoint test: 200 {"message":"Webhook endpoint is active"}
```

## Architecture Fix
**Before**: Routes â†’ Middleware â†’ Static â†’ Bot Routes
**After**: Bot Routes â†’ Health â†’ Middleware â†’ Static

This ensures webhook has highest priority and won't be intercepted.

## Test After Deployment
1. Webhook setup should succeed with `ok: true`
2. Bot responds to `/start` command
3. Mini app opens from bot keyboard
4. Full marketplace functionality active

The webhook route priority issue has been resolved - redeploy to apply the fix.
