# ðŸ”§ Render Build Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The Render build was failing with `sh: 1: vite: not found` because build dependencies weren't properly available during the build process.

## Fix Applied
1. **Build Dependencies Moved**: Installed vite, esbuild, and other build tools as production dependencies
2. **Build Command Updated**: Changed from `npm ci` to `npm install` in render.yaml
3. **Docker Optimized**: Updated Dockerfile to use `npm install` for all dependencies

## Files Updated
- `render.yaml` - Updated buildCommand to use `npm install`
- `Dockerfile` - Updated to install all dependencies during build
- Build dependencies now available in production dependencies

## Build Status
âœ… Local build working: `npm run build` executes successfully
âœ… Vite builds frontend assets properly  
âœ… esbuild bundles backend correctly
âœ… All dependencies resolved

## Deployment Ready
Your Telegram Channel Marketplace is now ready for successful deployment on Render with:
- Working build process
- PostgreSQL database integration
- 24/7 uptime configuration
- Health monitoring endpoints

Re-trigger your Render deployment - the build should now complete successfully!
