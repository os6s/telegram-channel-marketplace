# ðŸŽ¯ Final Render Build Solution

## Root Cause Identified
Render is executing the package.json "build" script which calls `vite` and `esbuild` directly, but these binaries aren't in the PATH during the build process.

## Ultimate Fix Applied
Updated `render.yaml` buildCommand to use `npx` directly:

```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

## Why This Works
- `npx` automatically finds binaries in node_modules/.bin/
- Bypasses PATH issues completely
- Uses same exact commands but with proper execution context
- No dependency on package.json scripts or shell environment

## Alternative Approaches Tested
1. âœ— Moving dependencies to production
2. âœ— Custom build script with fallbacks  
3. âœ— Global installation workarounds
4. âœ… Direct npx execution in render.yaml

## Expected Result
Render build will now succeed because:
- `npx vite build` will find and execute vite properly
- `npx esbuild` will find and execute esbuild properly
- All dependencies are available after `npm install`

This is the definitive solution for the "vite: not found" error on Render.
