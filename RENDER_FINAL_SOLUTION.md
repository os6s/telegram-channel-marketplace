# üîß FINAL SOLUTION: Redirect Middleware Disabled

## Critical Decision Made
**Temporarily disabled the redirect middleware entirely** to isolate the root cause of the Mini App redirect issue.

## Current State
- **Redirect Middleware**: DISABLED for testing
- **Webhook Routes**: Still working (bypassed)
- **API Routes**: Still working (bypassed)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added for all root path requests

## What This Will Show
After deploying, the logs will reveal:
1. **Exact headers and parameters** when accessing from Telegram Mini App
2. **User agent patterns** from Telegram WebApp
3. **Referrer information** from Telegram environment
4. **Any Telegram-specific headers** we might have missed

## Expected Test Results

### From Telegram Mini App:
```
üîç ALL ROOT REQUESTS - REDIRECT DISABLED: {
  path: "/",
  userAgent: "...",
  referer: "...",
  telegramHeaders: [...],
  allHeaders: {...}
}
‚úÖ Allowing all requests - redirect middleware disabled
```

### Success Criteria:
- Mini App should load properly in Telegram (no redirects)
- External browsers will also load (but that's temporary for testing)
- We can analyze the exact request patterns

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy and test** - Mini App should work in Telegram
2. **Analyze logs** - See exact Telegram request characteristics  
3. **Re-enable redirect** with proper detection based on real data
4. **Add external-only redirect** that won't interfere with Telegram

This approach will definitively show us what Telegram Mini App requests look like so we can build accurate detection.
