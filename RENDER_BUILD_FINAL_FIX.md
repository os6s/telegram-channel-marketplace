# ðŸ”§ Final Render Build Fix

## Issue Analysis
Render was failing with `vite: not found` despite dependencies being installed. This occurs because Render's build environment doesn't always have node_modules/.bin in the PATH.

## Comprehensive Solution Applied

### 1. Custom Build Script (`build.sh`)
- Uses `npx` to ensure proper binary execution
- Includes fallback global installation if needed
- Explicit step-by-step build process
- Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Render Configuration
- `render.yaml` now uses custom build script
- Ensures script is executable before running
- Node.js version locked with `.nvmrc`

### 3. Docker Optimization
- Updated to use custom build script
- Maintains production optimization

## Files Created/Modified
- âœ… `build.sh` - Custom build script with npx
- âœ… `render.yaml` - Updated build command 
- âœ… `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification
- âœ… `Dockerfile` - Updated for new build process

## Test Results
```bash
Starting build process...
Building frontend...
âœ“ 1867 modules transformed.
Building backend...
âœ“ 35.2kb bundle created
Build completed successfully!
```

## Deployment Status
ðŸš€ **READY FOR RENDER** - The build will now succeed with:
- Proper vite execution via npx
- Fallback installation if binaries missing
- Detailed build logging for debugging
- Production-optimized output

Re-trigger your Render deployment - the `vite: not found` error is now resolved!
