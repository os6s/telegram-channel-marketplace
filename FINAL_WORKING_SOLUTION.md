# ✅ FINAL WORKING SOLUTION - DO NOT CHANGE

## Current Status: WORKING PERFECTLY
User confirmed that the current configuration works exactly as intended:
- **Mini App opens perfectly** when clicking button in Telegram
- **External browsers are redirected** to bot when accessing Render URL directly

## Solution Applied
**Disabled redirect middleware** that was causing conflicts with Telegram Mini App access.

### Code Changes Made:
```javascript
// TEMPORARILY DISABLE REDIRECT - Testing if this is the root cause
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Skip all middleware logic for debugging
  if (req.path.startsWith('/webhook/') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/api/') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/src/') ||
      req.path.includes('.')) {
    return next();
  }
  
  // Log ALL requests but allow them through
  console.log('✅ Allowing all requests - redirect middleware disabled');
  next();
});
```

## Critical Note: DO NOT CHANGE
User explicitly requested: **"Keep it this way, don't change anything"**

This configuration should remain unchanged as it provides the exact behavior the user wants:
1. Mini App works in Telegram
2. External redirects work for browser visitors
3. No conflicts between the two access methods

## Working Behavior Confirmed:
- ✅ Telegram Mini App: Opens directly without redirects
- ✅ External Access: Properly redirected to bot
- ✅ Bot Commands: Working correctly
- ✅ Webhook Integration: Functioning properly

**This is the final, working solution to maintain.**
