# ðŸ”§ Critical Webhook Redirect Issue Fixed

## Root Cause Identified âœ…
**The redirect middleware was intercepting Telegram's webhook validation requests!**

When Telegram tries to validate the webhook URL `https://telegram-channel-marketplace.onrender.com/webhook/telegram`, it was being redirected to `https://t.me/giftspremarketbot` instead of reaching the actual webhook endpoint.

## Issue Analysis
1. **Redirect Middleware**: Catches external requests and redirects to Telegram bot
2. **Telegram Validation**: Bot platform sends validation request to webhook URL
3. **Conflict**: Validation request gets redirected instead of processed
4. **Result**: Telegram receives 301 redirect instead of 200 OK, causing 404 error

## Fix Applied
### Enhanced Middleware Logic:
- **Webhook Routes**: Completely bypass redirect for `/webhook/` paths
- **API Routes**: Bypass redirect for `/api/` paths  
- **Bot Requests**: Detect and bypass Telegram bot validation requests
- **Detailed Logging**: Track what requests are being redirected vs bypassed

### New Bypass Conditions:
```javascript
// Skip for webhook and API routes
if (req.path.startsWith('/webhook/') || req.path.startsWith('/api/')) {
  return next();
}

// Skip for Telegram bot validation requests
if (userAgent.includes('TelegramBot') && !req.path.startsWith('/')) {
  return next();
}
```

## Expected Results After Redeploy
```
Bypassing redirect for: /webhook/telegram
POST test status: 200
Current webhook info: {...}
Delete webhook result: { ok: true }
âœ… Webhook configured successfully for production
```

This fix ensures Telegram's webhook validation requests reach the actual endpoint instead of being redirected.
