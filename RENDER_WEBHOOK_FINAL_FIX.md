# ðŸ”§ Webhook Final Fix - Absolute Priority Route

## Issue Analysis
The webhook endpoint was being overridden by the static file serving catch-all route (`app.use("*", ...)`). Despite registering bot routes first, the static serving middleware was still intercepting webhook requests.

## Final Solution Applied
### 1. âœ… Absolute Priority Registration
- Webhook route registered at the very beginning of `registerRoutes()`
- Placed BEFORE any other middleware or routes
- No dependencies on bot class initialization

### 2. âœ… Direct Request Handling
- Simplified webhook handling without circular imports
- Direct processing of Telegram updates
- Immediate response to prevent timeouts

### 3. âœ… Test Endpoint Active
- GET `/webhook/telegram` returns JSON response
- Confirms route is properly registered
- Bypasses static file serving

## Expected Results
After redeploy, you should see:
```
Registering webhook route with highest priority...
âœ… Webhook configured successfully for production
Webhook endpoint test: 200 {"message":"Webhook endpoint is active"}
```

## Architecture Priority
**Route Registration Order:**
1. **Webhook routes** (absolute priority)
2. **Bot setup routes**  
3. **API routes**
4. **Middleware**
5. **Static serving** (catch-all last)

This ensures webhook requests never reach the static file serving that was returning HTML.

## Test After Deployment
1. Bot `/start` command should work
2. Mini app should open from bot
3. Webhook logs should show actual Telegram updates

The webhook route now has absolute priority and will not be intercepted by static serving.
